The Rhodes College Vision Statement proclaims that the College “aspires to
graduate students with a life-long passion for learning, a compassion for
others, and the ability to __translate academic study and personal concern
into effective leadership and action in their communities and the world.__”

In the Computer Science program at Rhodes, we take the last statement of the
vision especially seriously. We recognize that computer science and the
technologies enabled by computers have enormous impact on society. Computer
scientists have the ability to enable rapid, large-scale change—change that can
help society and individuals or can reinforce structures that marginalize and
impose inequality.

As such, we are firmly committed to creating computer scientists that recognize
their value __and responsibility__ to society.

Trained computer scientists have specialized abilities, knowledge, and
positions. As a result, this specialization requires that computer scientists
have a duty to society, just as do many other trained specialists like medical
doctors.

As in the Association for Computing Machinery’s (ACM) [Code of
Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics), this duty starts with a commitment
to use your training as a computer scientist for the betterment of society and
world, recognizing your potential for positive contributions and for harm.
Rhodes Computer Science students are trained to be actively ethical in their
practice, taking ethical considerations as core to their approach to the
research and development of technologies.

Along with this, central to the department’s ethical mission are its core values
of diversity and inclusion. We believe that not only should computer science be
open and accessible to every student regardless of background, but that __a
diverse field is critical to the success of a society__ that is enabled by
technology. __Computer Science at Rhodes is for everyone.__

Each course in the Computer Science program has learning objectives designed to
specially address this mission, and the
culminating senior experience for CS students is to build a software system or
engage in independent research that has a clear and justifiable benefit for
society.

As a computer science student at Rhodes, you will not only be prepared for an
exciting and impactful career, but you will also be prepared to enable
and enact real and powerful change.
