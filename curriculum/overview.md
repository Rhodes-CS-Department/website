## Getting started in computer science

We encourage every student at Rhodes to explore taking a computer science course.  No prior experience with computer science or programming is required to get started, and computer science combines well with many other disciplines.

### For students with little or no experience

If you've never taken a computer science course before, or maybe you've done a little bit of programming, 
the place for you to start is COMP 141: Computer Science I - Programming Fundamentals.  This course will introduce you 
to computer science concepts and teach you how to program in Python, a powerful, real-world programming 
language that is also well-suited to beginners.  You'll learn how to create programs that can process data, play games, draw pictures

### For students with more experience

If you've taken the AP Computer Science "A" exam and scored a 3 or better, or if you have significant previous programming
experience, you may want to start with Computer Science 142: Object-Oriented Programming.
