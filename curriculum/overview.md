Rewrite: Our curriculum has theory and practice.  It will prepare you for industry and graduate school.  It is super-awesome.

You can major, minor, or just take the classes you want.  All our courses are open to all students.

The lower-level courses in computer science are anchored by our introductory programming
sequence, which consists of Computer Science 141, 142, and 241.  We recommend students
who are thinking about majoring or minoring in computer science complete these courses
in consecutive semesters if possible, to minimize 

## How to get started

We encourage every student at Rhodes to explore taking a computer science course.  *No prior experience with computer science or programming is required to get started*, 
and computer science combines well with many other disciplines.  

There are a few different pathways to getting started:

**For students with little or no programming experience:**

If you've never taken a computer science course before, or maybe you've done a little bit of programming, 
the place for you to start is COMP 141: Computer Science I - Programming Fundamentals.  This course will introduce you 
to computer science concepts and teach you how to program in Python, a powerful, real-world programming 
language that is also well-suited to beginners.  You'll learn how to create programs that can process data, 
make decisions, play games, draw pictures, and solve a variety of real-world problems.  *Most students at Rhodes
begin with COMP 141*.

**For students with more programming experience:**

If you've taken the AP Computer Science "A" exam and scored a 3 or better, or if you have significant previous programming
experience, you may want to start with Computer Science 142: Object-Oriented Programming.  We recommend this for students
who are confident in their beginning programming abilities: if you know how to write if statements, loops, functions

Note that the AP Computer Science Principles exam does not automatically exempt you from COMP 141.  If your only
experience with computer science is through this exam, then please sign up for COMP 141.

**For students with some prior programming experience who aren't sure which class to take:**

Talk to any computer science professor, and we can help you figure out if you should start in CS 141 or CS 142.

## After Computer Science 141

If you took Computer Science 141 and enjoyed it, there are lots of options for continuing in
computer science at Rhodes. 

**If you know you want to major in CS:**

If you're sure you want to major in computer science, we recommend taking Computer Science 142 immediately
after Computer Science 141.  If you have a second slot open in your schedule at the same time, we recommend
taking either CS 172 or CS 231 at the same time as CS 142, as both of these courses are also required for the major
and have only CS 141 as a prerequisite.

**If you think you might want to major in CS, but you aren't sure, or if you want to minor:**
In this case, we recommend you still take Computer Science 142 immediately
after Computer Science 141, to help you retain as much knowledge as possible.  After
completing 142, you can decide if you want to complete the major, the minor, or just 
the computer science courses you happen to be interested in.

## Next steps

Once you have completed Computer Science 141 and 142, you should think about taking Computer Science 241, which
focuses on Data Structures and Algorithms, and completes the introductory three-course programming sequence.
Other lower-level courses required for both the major and minor are COMP 231 and COMP 172.  Once you are
done with the lower-level courses, you can explore our upper-level electives .
