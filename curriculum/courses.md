The software systems we often find the most useful and magical are also the largest and most complex to build and understand. In order for these systems to be reliable, maintainable, and secure, they must be built according to disciplined and well-founded methods. This course examines these methods—both in the large (defining requirements, system design, architecture patterns, software process, etc.) and in the small (version control, testing, benchmarking, code review, etc.). At the same time, students will engage in the construction of a large software system or feature.

**COMP 486: Senior Seminar**\
*<i class="ri-arrow-right-circle-line"></i>Prerequisite: senior standing. <i class="ri-calendar-check-line"></i>Offered every year.*\
Students embark on a semester long group project. Each team will produce a robust, scalable, and maintainable large-scale piece of software based on the project proposal completed in COMP 485. In addition to collaborating on a specific project, students present material on a wide range of software development topics, including software engineering, professional ethics, and current trends in languages, tools, and methodologies. As a senior seminar, the course has a strong problem-solving focus, encourages student participation and leadership, develops communication skills, and stresses integration of the student's full undergraduate experience.
