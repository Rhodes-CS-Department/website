Students will be introduced to various models and learn how to apply them in practice. Topics include classification, clustering, association rules, and recommender systems.

COMP 350 Theory of Computation
A study of theoretical models for computing. The hierarchy of finite state machines, pushdown machines, context free grammars, and Turing machines will be analyzed, along with their variations. The basic concepts of decidability, complexity theory, and NP-Complete problems will be introduced. (Course offered in alternate years; scheduled for 2016-2017.)

COMP 355 Advanced Algorithms
An in-depth study of the design and analysis of advanced algorithms, including the performance tradeoffs and resources required by
various algorithmic implementations. Major classes of computational problems will be identified and explored. Advanced data structures
and approximation heuristics are introduced as required for solution design. Topics vary depending on the specific problems covered but

semantics of programming languages, and various implementation approaches are covered.

COMP 365 Software Engineering
The software systems we often find the most useful and magical are also the largest and most complex to build and understand. In order for these systems to be reliable, maintainable, and secure, they must be built according to disciplined and well-founded methods. This course examines these methods—both in the large (defining requirements, system design, architecture patterns, software process, etc.) and in the small (version control, testing, benchmarking, code review, etc.). At the same time, students will engage in the construction of a large software system or feature.
