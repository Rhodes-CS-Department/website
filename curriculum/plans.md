**About these plans**: All of these plans assume the student does not arrive with any AP, IB, or transfer credits---in 
those cases, students will have more free electives.

In each of the plans below, we assume the student is taking all of their degree requirements at Rhodes.  These
requirements are:
- 3 courses in Search, Life, or Cultural Knowledge (F1)
- 1 course in first-year writing seminar
- 3 courses in a foreign language (F10)
- 8 courses in the remaining foundations requirements; 1 each in F2i, F3, F4, F5, F7, F8, F9, and F11 *[Note that F6 is obtained through the CS major requirements, and so is not listed here.]*
- 13 courses encompassing the computer science major requirements, (11 computer science and 2 math) *[Note that the the 1-credit fall portion of senior seminar is not
included here.]*

This totals 30 classes.  In a normal 4-year curriculum, students will take 32 classes, so following these plans still allows for two free electives.

In many cases, students will arrive with AP, IB, or other transfer credits, or will take a course that satisfies multiple requirements, which allows for
more free electives in their schedule.

## Plans:

- Start 141 in fall of the first year, doubling up on CS courses ASAP (good for those who know they want to major)
- Start 141 in fall of the first year, not doubling up until necessary (good for those who aren't sure if they want to major)
- Start 141 in the spring of the first year
- Start 141 in the fall of the sophomore year
- Start 141 in the spring of the sophomore year
