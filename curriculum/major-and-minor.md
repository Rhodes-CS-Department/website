## Majoring in Computer Science

To major in computer science, you must complete the following courses.  All of these courses
are four credits, except for the fall component of senior seminar, which is only one credit; this comes
to 53 total credits.

- The three-course introductory computer science sequence (Computer Science 141, 142, and 241).
- Two mid-level courses in discrete structures (Computer Science 172) and computer organization (Computer Science 231).
- Five upper-level computer science electives as follows:
  - Operating Systems (Computer Science 330),
  - One computer science theory course, either Theory of Computation (Computer Science 350) or 
    Advanced Algorithms (Computer Science 355).
  - Three other computer science electives (numbered 300 or higher, not including 495/496) of your choice.
- One calculus course, which may be a version of Calculus I (Math 112, 115, 116) or Calculus II (Math 122); plus one additional
  mathematics course, which may be any mathematics or statistics course taught in the mathematics department.
- The computer science senior seminar sequence, which consists of a fall component (Computer Science 485, 1 credit),
  and a spring component (Computer Science 486).
  
### Guidance and suggestions

- Students intending to go to graduate school should try to take both Theory of Computation (Computer Science 350) *and* 
    Advanced Algorithms (Computer Science 355).
- If a student takes one of the Calculus I courses, Calculus II (Math 122) may count as the "additional" mathematics course.
- Good choices for the "additional" mathematics course include Statistics (i.e., Math 211), Calculus III (Math 233), or Linear Algebra (Math 261). 
- Certain fields of computer science such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer
	graphics may require knowledge of additional math (such as those courses listed above), and students intending further study in those
	areas may want to take additional math courses.
 

A total of fifty-three (53) credits as follows:

Computer Science 141, 142, 172, 231, 241, 330, 485, and 486.
Computer Science 350 or 355.
One of Mathematics 112, 115, 116, or 122; and one additional mathematics course.
Three additional four-credit computer science courses numbered above 300, excluding 495 and 496.

## Minoring in Computer Science

A total of twenty-four (24) credits as follows:

Computer Science 141, 142, 172, 231, and 241.
One additional four-credit computer science course numbered above 300.
