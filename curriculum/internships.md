Getting on-the-job experience while completing your computer science degree is extremely valuable.
Many of our students complete internships in Memphis during the fall or spring semesters, while others
choose to do internships during the summer either in Memphis or other cities.
We strongly encourage majors to pursue internship experiences as part of their academic program.

Students can receive academic credit for a qualifying internship.  Talk to your academic advisor
about policies for this.
