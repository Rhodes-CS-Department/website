Rhodes is well-known for facilitating research opportunities for undergraduate students, and the computer science program is no exception.  All of our
computer science faculty are active scholars and enjoy including undergraduates in the work.  Opportunities are available for students
to get involved with research during the regular fall and spring semesters or over the summer.  Many times these research projects culminate
in undergraduates publishing papers in journals and presenting at local, national, or international conferences.

## Opportunities for Students

To get involved, talk to the faculty member who you are interested in working with.  Most have webpages with descriptions of
their research interests and projects.
