## Welcome to Computer Science!

Computer science at Rhodes College provides students the opportunity to study the world of technology, computation, and algorithmic thinking in the context of a liberal arts education.  We offer a rigorous curriculum that blends theory and practice to prepare students for future opportunities in industry or graduate school.  

Whether you're interested in majoring, minoring, or just exploring computer science in combination with another field, you'll find courses here that will empower you to leverage computational thinking to make a difference in the world. 

In our department, you'll find:

- professors who are both dedicated teachers as well as active researchers, with numerous opportunities for students to get involved in cutting-edge research;
- project-based classes that illustrate how to solve a variety of computational problems;
- the chance to explore fields like artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, databases, distributed computing, high-performance computing, human-computer interaction, operating systems, machine learning, networking, programming languages, and robotics;
- opportunities for study abroad in various countries around the world;
- a large community of Rhodes computer science alumni with which to network;
- the chance to combine computer science with other fields like biology, business, economics, languages, mathematics, music, and physics.

Our graduates have gone onto careers in cybersecurity, game design, high-performance computing, database analytics, and machine learning, as well as in software development and engineering at a wide variety of organizations.  They have have furthered their computer science education at universities such as Brown, Carnegie Mellon, Northeastern, the University of Texas, the University of Utah, and Vanderbilt.  The employment outlook for computer scientists with liberal arts backgrounds is very strong.
