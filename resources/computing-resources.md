The department has a wide variety of computer resources available for both students and faculty.
Most resources are housed in Briggs Hall, which was renovated in 2018.  

## Linux Cluster

Thanks to a National Science Foundation grant authored by principal investigator 
Dr. Brian Larkins, the department has built a supercomputer cluster that students
and faculty can use for research projects.

The cluster system supports both high-performance and high-throughput workloads with an overall system capacity of 1,584 cores, 9TB of memory, and 504 TB of storage. It 
consists of a login server, storage server, 44 compute nodes, and a 100Gbit/s InfiniBand interconnect network. 

Students and faculty can access the cluster by contacting Professor Larkins.

## Virtual Reality Lab

Briggs Hall houses a virtual reality lab which contains equipment allow users to create endless 
virtual environments such as exploring a model of the human heart or navigating the ocean.
The lab was funded by a National Science Foundation grant authored by principal investigator 
Dr. Betsy Sanders.  This grant also funded an auxiliary motion-capture lab in McCoy Hall.

## Other Labs

In Briggs Hall, the department also has a dedicated hardware lab and two teaching computer labs.
