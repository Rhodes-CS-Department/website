The department has a wide variety of computer resources available for both students and faculty.
Most resources are housed in Briggs Hall, which was renovated in 2018.  

## CS Linux Environment

The computer science department maintains a Linux computer lab in Briggs 013, which is open to all students.
The lab contains 13 workstations running Ubuntu Linux. Seven of these machines are equipped with Altera
FPGA development boards for use in COMP 231. Students enrolled in COMP 231 have priority access to these
machines. Other CS systems classes also use the same Linux environment, so students in COMP 251 or
other upper-level systems classes may also use these machines.

Students can access the Linux environment remotely by connecting to `cslogin.arc.rhodes.edu` via SSH. You
will need to setup SSH keys before accessing the system from off-campus.

More information on using these machines can be found in the [CS Academic/Research Computing User Guide](https://rhodescollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HPCL/pages/2650538053/CS+Academic+Research+Computing+User+Guide).

## Linux Cluster

Thanks to a National Science Foundation grant authored by principal investigator 
Dr. Brian Larkins, the department has built a supercomputer cluster that students
and faculty can use for research projects.

The cluster system supports both high-performance and high-throughput workloads
with an overall system capacity of 2,112 cores, 11.6TB of memory, and 350 TB of
storage. It consists of a login server, storage server, 44 compute nodes, and a
100Gbit/s InfiniBand interconnect network. 

Information on accessing and using the cluster can be found in the [Lotus / HPC User Guide](https://rhodescollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HPCL/pages/2067169303/Lotus+HPC+User+Guide)

## Virtual Reality Lab

Briggs Hall houses a virtual reality lab which contains equipment allow users to create endless 
virtual environments such as exploring a model of the human heart or navigating the ocean.
The lab was funded by a National Science Foundation grant authored by principal investigator 
Dr. Betsy Sanders.  This grant also funded an auxiliary motion-capture lab in McCoy Hall.
